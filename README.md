## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- `npm` or your preferred package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables. You will need keys from both Firebase and Stripe.

    ```sh
    # Firebase Configuration (from your Firebase project settings)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    # ... add other Firebase config values

    # Stripe Configuration (from your Stripe dashboard)
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..." # Your Stripe secret key
    STRIPE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID="price_..." # Price ID for the monthly plan
    STRIPE_YEARLY_PRICE_ID="price_..." # Price ID for the yearly plan

    # Application URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    ```

4.  **Update Firebase Configuration:**

    Ensure the Firebase configuration object in `src/lib/firebase.ts` matches the one from your Firebase project.

### Running the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üîß Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will prepare your application for deployment.
